All original country-day observations that are either initial or represent a value (not note) change from the previous day are included. Economic measures (E1-E4) are not included.

They show how visits and length of stays at different places change in percentages compared to a baseline (the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3 to Feb 6, 2020). The data comes in three data frames that you can select by the 'type' parameter. The 'country' data frame contains country-day level data. The 'country_region' data frame provides regional data for the countries for which Google reports regional data. The 'us_county' data frame reports daily data for the U.S. at the county level.

#&gt; 33 Data are Google Search Volume (GSV) measures as provided by Google Trends API, with the default search term 'coronavirus'. The data comes in four data frames that you can select by the 'type' parameter and the sample period comprises Jan 1, 2020 up to date. The 'country' data frame lists GSV by country, to assess which country on average uses the search term most often over the sample period. The 'country-day' data frame reports daily search volume data for all countries that show up in the 'country' data frame. Each value is relative within country, meaning that values across countries cannot be compared directly. The 'region' and 'city' data frames list the relative GSV across regions and city within countries when provided by Google Trends. Keep in mind that within each data frame GSV are relative measures with a maximum of 100 indicating the highest search volume. This implies that GSV measures are not comparable across data frames.
